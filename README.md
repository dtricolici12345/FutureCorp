The second hackathon implemented at WildCodeSchool was named FutureCorp. It was a true embodiment of creativity and innovation. In just one day, we created an engaging and useful application that became a real find for anyone facing an apocalyptic-like situation.
Imagine: after the fall of a meteorite named Abdou, the world reverted to primitive times. In this new reality, the FutureCorp application became a mentor and companion for people confronted with the challenges of survival. It provides practical advice on how to obtain water, find food, secure warm shelter, and even entertain oneself in conditions of limited resources.
However, our project is not just about survival. We have a "Back to the Past" button that takes us back to the times before the catastrophe. Here, we can reminisce about how it was when civilization was at its peak. Restoring nostalgia and visualizing the past help us appreciate and understand the value of what we have now.
